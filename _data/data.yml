    summary: |
      I am Zahra a Ph.D in Computer Science at Arizona State University. I work at <a href="https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/">Yochan</a> research group directed by <a href="http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/">Prof. Subbarao Kambhampati</a>. My general research interest is in developing cutting-edge computational models and frameworks for trust and understanding human cognitive states to enhance human-AI interaction. I have extensive research experience in diverse areas such as automated planning, AI, human-AI interaction, human-robot interaction, reinforcement learning, machine learning, behavior modeling of humans using data, statistical modeling, decision-making frameworks, and game theory.

    assignments:
      - title: Mental model based framework of trust
        link: "#a"
        tagline: "In this work, we contextualize the userâ€™s trust and their consequent choice on whether or not to rely on the AI agent in terms of their mental model of the agent, and their preexisting expectations about the optimal way of solving the task. The agent on the other hand can either use behavior generated through its model, or explanations about its model, to influence both the userâ€™s expectations about the agent and their expectations about the task."

      - title: Trust-Aware Planning in longitudinal human robot interaction
        link: "#l"
        tagline: "In this work, we have propose a computational model for capturing and modulating trust in longitudinal  human-robot  interaction  where  the  robot  integrates  humanâ€™s trust and their expectations into planning to build and maintain trust over the interaction horizon.  By establishing the required level of trust, the robot can focus on maximizing the team goal by eschewing explicit explanatory or explicable behavior.  The human also with a high level of trust in the robot, might choose not to monitor the robot, or not to intervene by stopping the robot and save their resources."

      - title: Game-theoretic model of trust
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "In this work, we modeled a game theoretic model of trust in Human robot interaction setting and introduced a solution as a trust boundary which is a proper humanâ€™s monitoring strategy given the inferred trust. By choosing a monitoring strategy in that boundary, the human supervisor can assure that the robot or the artificial intelligent system will show a safe and interpretable behavior."

      - title: Negotiation-aware task allocation
        link: "#"
        tagline: "We  considered  a  task-allocation  problem  where  an  AI  Task  Allocator (AITA) comes up with a fair allocation for a group of humans. And the AITA is able to provide explanation in the form of negotiation tree to convince humans who thinks a counterfactual allocation is more fair."
