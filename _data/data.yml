    summary: |
      I am Zahra a Ph.D student at Arizona State University, majoring in Computer Science. I work at <a href="https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/">Yochan</a> research group directed by <a href="http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/">Prof. Subbarao Kambhampati</a>. My general research interest is to have robots and AIs which are aware of the human in their loop, so they are trustable and explainable, and appropriate for social good. My research interests are Human-robot interaction, automated planning, and game theory.
      You can find the latest version of my CV <a href="./Resume.pdf">here</a>.

    assignments:
      - title: Model of trust in monitoring a robot
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "In this work, we have investigated a human robot interaction scenario when a human supervisor has zero trust on a robot worker by modeling their interaction as Bayesian game. We introduce a notion of trust boundary that optimizes the supervisorâ€™s monitoring cost while ensuring that the robot workers stick to the safe plans."

      - title: Explaining AI-Moderated Task-Allocation Outcomes using Negotiation Trees
        link: "#"
        tagline: "We  considered  a  task-allocation  problem  where  an  AI  Task  Allocator (AITA) comes up with a fair allocation for a group of humans. And the AITA is able to provide explanation in the form of negotiation tree to convince humans who thinks a counterfactual allocation is more fair."
