{% assign thesis = site.data.data.thesis-sidebar %}
{% if thesis %}
<div class="thesis-container container-block">
  <h2 class="container-block-title">{{ thesis.title }}</h2>
  <a class="thesis-link" href="{{ thesis.link }}">{{ thesis.thesis_title }}</a>
</div>
{% endif %}
This approach separates the data (defined in "data.yml") from the presentation (defined in your HTML templates), making it easier to manage and update your thesis section. However, it's not mandatory to use this approach, and you can continue with your current HTML-based method if it suits your needs.
